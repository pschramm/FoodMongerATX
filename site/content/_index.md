    Shawn and Vanessa have been friends for over a decade. Their shared passion
    for food led to hours and days filled with conversation of opening their own
    culinary adventure.

    With a vision of fresh food and a freestyle menu, The Food Monger hatched in
    October of 2017. From handmade sauces to freshly pickled veggies to
    on-the-truck-cut fries and the freshest meat, their commitment to quality is
    unchallenged. Every item is prepared by Shawn and Vanessa. The ever-changing
    menu and the made-from-scratch items keep their minds thinking and your
    bellies hungry for more. Freestyle means no boundary on cuisines, flavors,
    or collaborations. Every venture is different, and that barely scratches the
    surface! The Food Monger has been blessed with a great support system of
    friends and family. This dream could not have gotten off the ground without
    the village that helped (and is helping) make it come true. Keep it Fresh &
    Freestyle friends!
